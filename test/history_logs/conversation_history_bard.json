The error message you're getting is:\n\n\nThe number of classes in file-cvbnsdfgfdsdfgcxvxc does not match the number of classes specified in the hyperparameters.\n\n\nThis means that the number of classes in your training data doesn't match the number of classes you specified when you fine-tuned your model. For example, if your training data has 10 classes, but you specified 5 classes when you fine-tuned your model, the fine-tuning process will fail.\n\nTo fix this error, you need to make sure that the number of classes in your training data matches the number of classes you specified when you fine-tuned your model. You can do this by either:\n\n* Changing the number of classes in your training data.\n* Changing the number of classes you specified when you fine-tuned your model.\n\nOnce you've made the necessary changes, you should be able to fine-tune your model without any errors.\n\nHere are some additional resources that may be helpful:\n\n* OpenAI documentation on fine-tuning: https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning\n* Stack Overflow question on fine-tuning errors: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76355721/openai-fine-tuning-training-data-exceeds-the-token-limit\n* OpenAI forum thread on fine-tuning errors: https://community.openai.com/t/cli-fine-tune-error-hard-billing-limit-exceeded/215258\n\nI hope this helps!
